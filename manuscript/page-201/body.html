<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">genius are, <em>ex vi termini</em>, <em>more</em> individual than any other peopleâ€”less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves, without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of moulds which society provides in order to save its members the trouble of forming their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced into one of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannot expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break their fetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded in reducing  them to commonplace, to point at with solemn warning as "wild," "erratic," and the like; much as if one should complain of the Niagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a Dutch canal.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the necessity of allowing it to unfold itself</p></div> </div>
