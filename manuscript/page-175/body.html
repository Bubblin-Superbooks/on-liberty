<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Toleration was the great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but do not let them abuse that precious word toleration. As he understood it, it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship, <em>among Christians, who worshipped upon the same foundation</em>. It meant toleration of all sects and denominations of <em>Christians who believed in the one mediation</em>." I desire to call attention to the fact, that a man who has been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this country, under a liberal Ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who do not believe in the divinity of Christ are beyond the pale of toleration. Who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion that religious persecution has passed away, never to return?</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
